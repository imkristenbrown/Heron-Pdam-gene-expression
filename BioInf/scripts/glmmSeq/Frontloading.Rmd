```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```

This is a Rmd file analyzing our raw count data by the glmmSeq package as described in the [vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/glmmSeq/vignettes/glmmSeq.html) and [manual](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/glmmSeq/glmmSeq.pdf).

```{r}
sessionInfo() #provides list of loaded packages and version of R. I still have version 4.1 for now.
```

```{r cars}
library(dplyr)
library(reshape2)
sessionInfo() #list of packages after library-ing these packages
```

From glmmSeq, I saved the following output:
"signif_genes_rawcts.csv" #save this as csv for downstream analysis
"signif_genes_cts.csv" #save this as csv for downstream analysis
"signif_genes_normcts.csv" #save this as csv for downstream analysis

```{r}
DEGs <- read.csv(file="signif_genes_normcts.csv", sep=',', header=TRUE) 
```
